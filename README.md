# tda-option-position-viewer
 
A quick script to open a tkinter window and show your current option positions (refreshing data every 3 seconds) in your TD Ameritrade account, indicating base details such as strike, expiration date, and underlying ticker. Then there will be the columns on the right with underlying spot price and calculations of how far from the money your positions are.

You'll need to set your 3 params in TDSession corresponding to your TD login details.
